This repository contains the code for a Weather application built primarily with NodeJS for the backend and Handlebars/CSS for the frontend. This code runs as a small website in the browser, allowing users to enter a location and get back the current temperature and the feels like temperature. This app uses the mapbox API to geocode locations, and the Weatherstack API to convert the geocode to the weather forecast for the area given.
